UsingPersonas:
This month, with better coordination and communication between the three teams involved in the project, we didnâ€™t only work with the "Personas" we created, but also used Personas from other teams, and they used ours too. Because of this, we realized that when we made our Personas, we added some information that was not very useful for the project. We also learned how important it is to use this technique correctly. If not, it can create confusion and lead to wrong decisions. These mistakes can affect small things like a print report button, or even bigger things like changing a full view or section for specific tasks.

For example, with the "Add Patient" button: in a procedural way, it makes sense to only show it when creating a first appointment. But if we use the information from the receptionist's Persona, we could think about making the button easier to see and more accessible, because sometimes they need to add patients outside of the first appointment process.
