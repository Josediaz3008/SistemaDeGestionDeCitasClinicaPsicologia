UX (User Experience) is about how a person feels when they use a website or app. It includes how easy it is to use, how fast it is, and if the person is happy using it. Good UX helps users find what they need quickly and enjoy using the site.

UI (User Interface) is about how the website or app looks. It includes colors, buttons, menus, and text. Good UI makes the website nice to look at and easy to click or move around.


At the beginning of the month, my team focused more on finding quality attributes that were not about usability in our project. But in the end, we focused more on the UI and forgot a bit about the UX. However, the three teams involved in the project started to communicate better. With brainstorming, discussions, and sharing information between us, we got different points of view. That helped us use the UI we had planned but improve the UX based on the opinions of new people. Still, feedback from users could really help us clear doubts about our prototype and improve it with the users' opinions.
