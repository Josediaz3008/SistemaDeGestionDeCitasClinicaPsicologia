# Elicitation Methods  

## Considerations of the Elicitation Technique  

In our project, we used interviews with key users as an elicitation technique to identify functional and non-functional requirements.  
This technique is useful because it allows us to gather information directly from end users and adapt software development to their actual needs.  
However, it also has limitations, as interviewees may provide subjective or incomplete information.  

> **Reflection:** Interviews are useful, but obtaining accurate data can be challenging since people may give conflicting or biased opinions based on their experiences.

## Implementation in Our Team  

For our appointment system, we conducted interviews with the clinic administrator and staff involved in the appointment process.  
We asked them about the previous design and potential improvements they considered necessary.  
Thanks to having guided questions at the beginning, the interview was efficient and concise, but later it became repetitive.  
Therefore, we decided to move on to another activity to gain a better understanding.  

> **Reflection:** We should have a structured interview plan and clear objectives before and during the interview to avoid redundancies.

## Results and Improvements  

The elicitation results were useful, but we noticed that some requirements were repeated, leading to wasted time and potential confusion within the team.  

> **Reflection:** The results were positive, but we can improve the process by collecting more data through different techniques to avoid misunderstandings or contradictions.
