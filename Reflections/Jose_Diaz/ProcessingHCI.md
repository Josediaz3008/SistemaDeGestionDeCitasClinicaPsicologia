    <h3>Relationship between HCI, Usability, and UX</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</em> is a field that focuses on analyzing and understanding the interaction between people and computers. <em>Usability</em> is a subset of HCI and specifically focuses on the ease and efficiency of using a system. <em>User Experience (UX)</em>, on the other hand, involves the overall user perception of a product, including emotional, aesthetic, and accessibility factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship between these three concepts is crucial in modern software development. A system may be functional and fulfill its purpose but may not be usable or provide a satisfying experience. For example, a scheduling system might allow users to enter an appointment, but if the process requires navigating through multiple submenus, it can become frustrating.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The key is to integrate HCI, usability, and UX to create systems that not only function but also provide a pleasant and stress-free experience for users.</p>
    
    <h3>Difference between Usability and UX</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Usability focuses on the ease of use, efficiency, and effectiveness of a system, whereas UX considers the emotional impact and overall user satisfaction.</em> The main difference is that UX provides a broader perspective that not only encompasses functionality but also how the user feels when interacting with the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our project, this difference can be seen in the way appointments are scheduled. While the scheduling process is highly usable, it can become cumbersome if it is not self-explanatory, preventing the user from understanding what is happening within the system and what actions they are performing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The essential difference between usability and UX lies in the fact that while usability optimizes efficiency, UX aims for an experience that involves emotions and feelings, which is crucial for the userâ€™s overall satisfaction.</p>
    
    <h3>UX Feature for the Project</h3>
    <p>
        One <em>UX feature we analyzed for inclusion</em> is <em>self-explanatory design</em>. This means that the system should allow users to understand what they are doing within it. For example, highlighting possible actions when hovering over them could help prevent frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
        This could improve the user experience by reducing cognitive load and avoiding errors. Additionally, to assess its impact on UX, we could conduct user tests to measure the time required to complete tasks before and after implementing these changes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Implementing these features in the system would reduce cognitive load and help prevent frustration and rejection of the new system.</p>
