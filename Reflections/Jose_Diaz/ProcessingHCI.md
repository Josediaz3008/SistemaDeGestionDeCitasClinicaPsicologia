# Processing HCI  

## Relationship between HCI, Usability, and UX  

**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** focuses on analyzing and understanding the interaction between people and computers.  
**Usability** is a subset of HCI and specifically focuses on the ease and efficiency of using a system.  
**User Experience (UX)** involves the overall perception of a product, including emotional, aesthetic, and accessibility factors.  

> **Reflection:** The key is to integrate HCI, usability, and UX to create systems that not only function but also provide a pleasant and stress-free experience for users.

## Difference between Usability and UX  

Usability focuses on ease of use, efficiency, and effectiveness, whereas UX considers the emotional impact and overall satisfaction of the user. A system may be usable but not provide a good user experience.  

> **Reflection:** The essential difference lies in the fact that while usability optimizes efficiency, UX aims for an experience that involves emotions and feelings.

## UX Feature for the Project  

One UX feature we analyzed for inclusion is **self-explanatory design**. The system should allow users to understand what they are doing.  
For example, **highlighting possible actions when hovering over them** could help prevent frustration.  

> **Reflection:** Implementing these features in the system would reduce cognitive load and help prevent frustration and rejection of the new system.
