    <h1>Relationship between HCI, Usability, and UX</h1>
    <p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on analyzing and understanding the interaction between people and computers. Usability is a subset of HCI and specifically focuses on the ease and efficiency of using a system. User Experience (UX) involves the overall perception of a product, including emotional, aesthetic, and accessibility factors.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> <span class="reflection">The key is to integrate HCI, usability, and UX to create systems that not only function but also provide a pleasant and stress-free experience for users.</span></p>
    
    <h2>Difference between Usability and UX</h2>
    <p>Usability focuses on ease of use, efficiency, and effectiveness, whereas UX considers the emotional impact and overall satisfaction of the user. A system may be usable but not provide a good user experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> <span class="reflection">The essential difference lies in the fact that while usability optimizes efficiency, UX aims for an experience that involves emotions and feelings.</span></p>
    
    <h2>UX Feature for the Project</h2>
    <p>One UX feature we analyzed for inclusion is self-explanatory design. The system should allow users to understand what they are doing. For example, highlighting possible actions when hovering over them could help prevent frustration.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> <span class="reflection">Implementing these features in the system would reduce cognitive load and help prevent frustration and rejection of the new system.</span></p>
