UI vs UX
When I started building the prototype, I investigated what UI and UX really mean. From what I found, UI is what you see like the buttons, colors, and layout while UX is about how it feels to use the app, both are super important when you're designing something that people will actually use.
In my appointment calendar, I gave each patient their own color. Itâ€™s a small visual touch, but it makes it easier to tell them apart and just makes the screen look nicer. This kind of thing helps the admin staff at the SEAP clinic use the system more comfortably.
For the UX part, I broke down the process of scheduling an appointment into smaller steps. That way, even though the process is a bit long, it feels more manageable and gives users a sense of progress as they go.
What I learned is that while nice colors make the screen look good, but smooth flows that really make a system enjoyable to use. Finding that balance between looking good and feeling good is the lesson I got from working on the prototype.
